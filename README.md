## Usage

For instructions on how to use the Styleguide in your project refer to the page itself: https://vtex.github.io/styleguide/.

## Developing

### Setup

```shell
yarn install
```

### Running

```shell
yarn styleguide
```

### Storybook

We use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) environment to help us build and test our components in real time. You can edit the Playground file and add the components you are working on, after this run the command below to see your changes in http://localhost:6006/ :

```shell
yarn storybook
```

If you want to change or add stories, take a look at this [guide](https://github.com/vtex/styleguide/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#storybook-organization) before.

## Developing using `npm link`

Run this in this repo:

```shell
yarn develop
```

In your project run:

```
npm link @vtex/styleguide
```

Import (case a `<Button>` component in lib):

```js
import Button from '@vtex/styleguide/lib/Button'
```

## Testing

### Developing new tests

To add tests to a component, just add a test file with the `.test.js` extension next to the component implementation.

Example:

```shell
react/components/Alert/
├── README.md
├── index.js
└── index.test.js
```

We use [react-testing-library](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library) to test our components.

### Running tests

To run the test use:

```shell
yarn test
```

You can also pass the `--watch` flag:

```shell
yarn test --watch
```

### Publishing

---

To post the changelog on Github Release Notes, is required to configure a Personal Token. [See more here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/releasy#settings)

We use [releasy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/releasy) to publish our styleguide. To publish on both npm and render(VTEX IO) with Github Release Notes, execute the command below:

```shell
releasy --stable
```

### Docs

To update the docs:

```shell
yarn deploy
```

#### Known issues

- Your project has to run with webpack >= 2. Here's a [guide](https://webpack.js.org/migrate/3/) for upgrading Webpack to v2.

- `VTEX Styleguide` is a project built to run on top of either `npm` or `VTEX IO`. To
  make this viable, we currently use two `package.json` files, one in the top repository
  folder for `npm`, and one inside the `react` folder for `VTEX IO`. We are
  looking into how we can improve this architecture, but for now we have to live
  with duplicated dependencies in these `package.json` files.

  For more info, please refer to https://github.com/vtex/styleguide/issues/483

- We currently have two majors of the Styleguide, `8.x` and `9.x` (master branch).
  Each major supports a specific VTEX's Render version.
  This means that we develop new features only on the `master` branch (9.x major) and do bug fixes on both `master` and `8.x` branches.

#### Custom icons

The `icon` components supports customization through the `<use>` element available in SVG. [Read more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/use)

**How to use:** In the same page that has a icon, load in any place inside the `<html>` a SVG with the following structure:
```svg
<svg class="dn" height="0" version="1.1" width="0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <defs>
    <g id="icon-columns">
      <path d="M10.8 4.4L9.4 3L5.4 7L3.4 5L2 6.4L5.4 9.8L10.8 4.4Z" fill="currentColor" />
    </g>
    <g id="OTHER-ICON-ID">
      <path d="M11.7 0.3C11.5 0.1 11.3 0 11 0H10V3C10 3.6 9.6 4 9 4H4C3.4 4 3 3.6 3 3V0H1C0.4 0 0 0.4 0 1V15C0 15.6 0.4 16 1 16H15C15.6 16 16 15.6 16 15V5C16 4.7 15.9 4.5 15.7 4.3L11.7 0.3ZM13 14H3V11C3 10.4 3.4 10 4 10H12C12.6 10 13 10.4 13 11V14Z" fill="currentColor"/>
      <path d="M9 0H7V3H9V0Z" fill="currentColor"/>
    </g>
  </defs>
</svg>
```
- The ID must match the ID of the icon you want to replace. To see all available options, [view icons folder](https://github.com/vtex/styleguide/tree/master/react/components/icon).
- Inside one SVG you can have more than one `<g id="">`, one for each icon you want to update.
