In addition to the props above, InputButton accepts all the props the Input component does.

#### A input with a button should be used in scenarios where the field needs its own button. Newsletter sign up, postal code input and promo code application are some common use case examples.

### üëç Dos

- Use it when more fields will be loaded below after submission, or when what was typed will be applied.
- Use it when you have an input and a button in-line and the button is directly related to the input.
- Use it in its large size when it's you might need to call attention to the input's existence or it carries importance in the context.

### üëé Don'ts

- Don't use it exclusively for validating information that has been typed, prefer to do that automatically.
- Don't use it in situations where the input might be read-only or when there's more than one button directly related to the input.
- Don't use it in cramped spaces where the user might not be able to comfortably type the expected response, prefer to use the default input with a button below.

### Related components

- Consider using a <a href="#/Components/Forms/Input">default input</a> with a suffix if you need to display information (e.g. tooltip) that doesn't qualify as a action.
- Use a <a href="#/Components/Forms/InputSearch">InputSearch</a> for search purposes or a <a href="#/Components/Forms/InputPassword">InputPassword</a> for password purposes.
