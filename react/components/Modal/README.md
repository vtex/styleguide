#### A modal is an overlay that demands the attention and action from the user, preventing her from interacting with the rest of the page. It might be used from displaying messages to providing a simple form to edit a record.

### üëç Dos

- Keep it simple. The content of a modal should represent one, clear action from the user - even if it takes multiple steps to be completed.
- Always use a modal to confirm any destructive actions.

### üëé Don'ts

- Avoid stacking modals on top of other modals.

### Related components

- For more complex actions and forms where you want to maintain the user context use the Drawer (work in progress).

Default

```js
const Button = require('../Button').default

class ModalExample extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super()
    this.state = { isModalOpen: false }
    this.handleModalToggle = this.handleModalToggle.bind(this)
    this.handleConfirmation = this.handleConfirmation.bind(this)
  }

  handleModalToggle() {
    this.setState({ isModalOpen: !this.state.isModalOpen })
  }

  handleConfirmation() {
    this.handleModalToggle()
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        <Button onClick={this.handleModalToggle}>Open</Button>
        <Modal
          centered

              The Payments module is the system responsible for managing all
              actions regarding your store's cash flow.
            </p>

            <p>
              Before we explore the features within VTEX Admin Payments, let's
              clarify some important concepts regarding the payment flow of an
              order. This process is performed by some actors within the
              Brazilian financial system, which make up the Payments module
              architecture.
            </p>
            <div
              style={{
                backgroundColor: '#edf4fa',
                borderRadius: '4px',
                border: 'solid #368df7',
                borderWidth: '0 0 0 4px',
                boxSizing: 'border-box',
                padding: '12px 16px',
              }}>
              It is important to remember that each store has its own
              particularities and its own operation, which influence how to
              build your business' Payment module. To set up your cash flow, it
              is therefore crucial to keep in mind the real needs and purposes
              of the retailer and of the desired project.

            <p className="f1 fw3">What is the shared cart</p>
            <p>
              The shared cart is a tool that allows more than one customer to
              add, remove or update items and informations from the same cart.
            </p>
            <p>
              For your customer, the shared cart means practicality when making
              a purchase. For your store, it means:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Opportunity for a larger sale.</li>
              <li>Lower logistics effort.</li>
              <li>Single order flow.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt8 f3 fw5">How this is technically possible</p>
            <p>
              We started using a parameter in the URL to identify the cart. As a
              result, the URL can be shared with other users, who can view the
              items, add and remove products, and even pay for the order.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, for users already registered in the plataform (whose data
              is filled automatically in the checkout), all personal
              informations are secure: only the informations' owner has access
              to them, after he is authenticated in the store.
            </p>
            <p className="mt8 f3 fw5">Information security</p>
            <p>
              The payment is still done by one person whose informations remain
              secure, since the profile and delivery data are visible only to
              the user who creates the cart. For others, these same data are
              masked because, with the shared cart, the cart does not have a
              single owner anymore, only the data has.
            </p>
            <p className="mt8 f3 fw5">Changes to the checkout URL</p>
            <p>
              As informed, we have a new parameter in the checkout URLs to
              identify the cart. However, the feature is optional, not impacting
              stores that do not use it.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to use this feature, simply insert the parameter (also
              called querystring) orderFormId, with the ID of the cart you want
              to access. The cart ID can be obtained from the checkout APIs -
              facilitated with VTEX.js.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please note that, as new parameters are inserted, the page
              crawling that is based on the URL can be affected. Therefore, it
              is necessary to adapt it to continue viewing those same pages as
              eing from the checkout.
            </p>
            <p>
              One change we can make is in the URLs of the Google Analytics
              conversion funnel, because it relies solely on the addresses that
              customers browsed. In order to have a funnel compatible with the
              additional parameters, see the rules updated in our article on how
              to set up the sales funnel on Google Analytics.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other scenarios should be checked with your marketing team and
              service providers.
            </p>
            <p className="mt8 f3 fw5">Practical use of the shared cart</p>
            <p>
              Summarizing all the previous informations, it is necessary to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                adapt the page crawling services so they become compatible with
                the new URL parameter (Google Analytics, for example);
              </li>
              <li>use VTEX APIs to obtain the cart ID;</li>
              <li>
                customize the cart's page to provide its link to the user based
                on the cart ID.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
